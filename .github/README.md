# Rooted Warden

Green is the color of HOPE. It shines through the dark, elevating the soul. A black, ominous presence crawls from the corners to strangle the hope with EVIL ROOTS. Then there’s you, the WARDEN. You answered the call to defend the LIGHT.

“Rooted Warden” is a dark and moody game of territory defense. Control the hero in a dungeon setting. Brawl with ever expanding roots of darkness. Save hope. Die trying.

Now come and entangle yourself in a curse.
